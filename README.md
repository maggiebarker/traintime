# traintime
firebase, jquery

This is a train schedule that utilizes a simple user input form that takes in the name of the train, its destination, the time of the first train's arrival each day, and how frequently (in minutes) the train arrives.  The train schedule table shows when the next train will arrive and counts down by the minute how soon the next train will arrive.

Data input by the user is stored in Firebase.
